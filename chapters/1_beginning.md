Dialog:
```
P: I've never seen you at the Metalab before. Is it your first time visiting?
  N: Yes
    P: Hmm.. actually i should give you a tour right now but today i have too much on my mind...
      N: Maybe i can help you, so you can give me a tour?
        P: Well, it's about a riddle Becca told me days ago. I've been thinking about it since and that's why i doubt you can solve it. I suspect it's about higher physics.
          N: But i do have a physics degree!
            P: Great! The riddle goes as follows: "A famous magician claims he can throw a ping pong ball so that it will go a short distance, come to full stop and then reverse itself. He would do so without bouncing the it of any object, or tie anything to it". How does he do it? You have three tries.
              N: He throws the ball so that it passes the moon and returns in a slingshot maneuver?
                P: Nope. She said the ball would go only a short distance.
                  N: He attachs a bottle rocket to the ball?
                    P: Nope. She said he wouldn't tie anything to the ball.
                      N. Hmmm. Hmmm. Hmmm. He throws it straight in the air and let's gravity do the rest?
                        P: He throws it straight...? In the air...? Oh my... *facepalm*. Ok. I'll give you the tour but please don't tell anyone that i spend days thinking about that riddle.
                          N: (Didn't need a physics degree for that one)
